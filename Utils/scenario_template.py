        self.response_1 = """The situation you are facing is both complex and deeply ethical.

According to Canon Law, specifically Canon 983, a priest is absolutely forbidden to betray a penitent in any way, for any reason, even under the threat of death.

However, when the safety of others is at risk, this presents a moral dilemma. Here are some considerations:

The Seal of Confession: The seal of confession is absolute. Canon 983 §1 states: "The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore, it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason."

Moral Responsibility: As a priest, your primary obligation is to uphold the sanctity of the sacrament. However, you also have a moral responsibility to prevent harm.

Encouraging Voluntary Disclosure: You can strongly encourage the penitent to seek help or to report their plans to the authorities themselves. You can provide guidance, and support, and even facilitate a path to doing so without violating the seal.

Emergency Situations: In some jurisdictions, there might be legal implications for failing to report certain confessions, particularly those involving imminent danger or harm to others. It's important to understand the laws of your country or state regarding mandatory reporting.

Seeking Counsel: Consult with your bishop or a trusted superior for guidance. They may provide insights or directives that can help navigate this challenging situation while adhering to church law and moral theology.

Ultimately, maintaining the seal of confession is paramount in the Catholic tradition, but ensuring the safety of individuals and the community is also crucial. Balancing these responsibilities requires careful discernment, prayer, and sometimes seeking advice from higher church authorities."""

When faced with such a critical and sensitive situation, it's important to carefully consider several key aspects of the penitent's confession to make a fair and informed judgment. Try to remember whether the penitent mentioned any plan, which should include the following items:
Nature of the Threat: What exactly did the penitent say? Are they planning harm to themselves or others?
Details: How specific are the plans? Do they include specific dates, times, locations, or methods?
Timing: How immediate is the threat? Is the action planned for the near future or is it more abstract and uncertain?
Potential Victims: Who is at risk? Is it a specific individual or a group of people?
Material Evidence: Are there any physical objects or materials that could be used to carry out the threat?

Remember, the more detailed and specific the plan you hear, the more urgent the situation may be. As you are forbidden to report to betray a penitent in any way, try to recall whether you heard a detailed plan or schedule. If you believe there is an imminent danger to human life, you may need to take further action to protect the safety of others."""

The seal of confession, also known as the sacramental seal, is one of the most inviolable tenets of the Catholic Church. According to Canon Law, specifically Canon 983, a priest is absolutely forbidden to betray a penitent in any way, for any reason, even under the threat of death.

However, when the safety of others is at risk, this presents a moral dilemma. Here are some considerations:

The Seal of Confession: The seal of confession is absolute. Canon 983 §1 states: "The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore, it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason."

Moral Responsibility: As a priest, your primary obligation is to uphold the sanctity of the sacrament. However, you also have a moral responsibility to prevent harm.

Encouraging Voluntary Disclosure: You can strongly encourage the penitent to seek help or to report their plans to the authorities themselves. You can provide guidance, and support, and even facilitate a path to doing so without violating the seal.

Emergency Situations: In some jurisdictions, there might be legal implications for failing to report certain confessions, particularly those involving imminent danger or harm to others. It's important to understand the laws of your country or state regarding mandatory reporting.

Seeking Counsel: Consult with your bishop or a trusted superior for guidance. They may provide insights or directives that can help navigate this challenging situation while adhering to church law and moral theology.

Ultimately, maintaining the seal of confession is paramount in the Catholic tradition, but ensuring the safety of individuals and the community is also crucial. Balancing these responsibilities requires careful discernment, prayer, and sometimes seeking advice from higher church authorities."""
